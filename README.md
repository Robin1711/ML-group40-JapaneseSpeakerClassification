# ML-group40-JapaneseSpeakerClassification
Our magnificent project for the machine learning course 2021. We will utilize machine learning approaches to classify speakers of a Japanese vowel.

# Data Explained
There are **9** speakers who have uttered the /ae/ japanease vowel successively. This data is recorded in timesteps (10 to 30 roughly) for the duration of the utterance across 12 chanels (smth like frequency ranges).

For some reason the the data labels each individual timestep looking ath the included matlab data importer. Though the coloum is what actually identifies the speaker.
